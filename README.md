# sniproxy

This is a reverse proxy for running multiple TLS services on the same IP
address and port. It does not decrypt the application data, but just
looks at the [Server Name Indication (SNI)][SNI] extension of the
unencrypted TLS `ClientHello` message to determine which backend to
forward the connection to.

[SNI]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication

Only Unix-like systems, with support for Unix domain sockets and passing
sockets as file descriptors, are supported. A Windows-friendly version
probably wouldn't be too hard, but I can't test it.

# Invocation

This program doesn't take any command line options, and doesn't have a
configuration file in a traditional sense.

First off, you have to pass a listening TCP socket as its stdin. There
are many ways to do that; the configuration examples below may help as a
starting point. If you need to listen on multiple sockets, run a
separate copy of sniproxy for each socket.

Second, create a directory to hold your backend configuration,
containing a subdirectory for each hostname you want to serve. The
working directory for sniproxy must be this top-level configuration
directory. Hostnames must be represented without a trailing dot (`.`)
and in lowercase ASCII. (So for international domain names, use the
"[A-label][]" form.)

[A-label]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5890#section-2.3.2.1

Each hostname subdirectory can have these files:

- `tls-socket` (required): a Unix domain socket that your backend
  application is listening for connections on.

- `send-proxy-v1`: if present (even empty), every connection forwarded
  for this host will be prefixed by a [PROXY protocol][] v1 header.

[PROXY protocol]: https://www.haproxy.org/download/2.1/doc/proxy-protocol.txt

These files or directories can also be symlinks, which allows a few
tricks.

- If multiple hostnames should be served by the same backend, they can
  all be symlinked to one directory, rather than configuring the backend
  to listen on many sockets.

- If `tls-socket` is a symlink to the actual socket, then you can
  atomically replace the symlink to change which backend process serves
  that hostname, without downtime.

For example, if your configuration directory is called `hosts/`, and
you're hosting a web site at "[üï∏üíç.ws][webring]", then you'd put the
backend socket for that site in `hosts/xn--sr8hvo.ws/tls-socket`, and
run sniproxy with the `hosts` directory as its current working
directory.

[webring]: https://üï∏üíç.ws

You can change the configuration without restarting sniproxy: it looks
up the target socket each time a connection comes in, and doesn't need
to know which hostnames to serve in advance.

That's it! You have a reverse proxy now.

To stop the proxy gracefully, send it a `SIGHUP` signal. (This currently
closes all connections immediately but that isn't what I intended?)

## Configuration examples

### systemd

If you use systemd, you can configure a pair of units to run sniproxy.

A socket unit might look like this, in `sniproxy.socket`:

```ini
[Socket]
ListenStream=443
```

If you've statically linked sniproxy, then it should work even under
fairly strict isolation, as in this example `sniproxy.service` unit:

```ini
[Unit]
Requires=sniproxy.socket

[Service]
Type=exec
StandardInput=socket
KillSignal=SIGHUP
TimeoutStopSec=10s

RootDirectoryStartOnly=yes
RootDirectory=/srv/sniproxy
ExecStartPre=+cp /usr/bin/sniproxy /srv/sniproxy
ExecStart=./sniproxy
ExecStartPost=-+rm /srv/sniproxy/sniproxy

User=sniproxy
ProtectSystem=yes
MountAPIVFS=no
PrivateNetwork=yes
RestrictAddressFamilies=AF_UNIX
MemoryDenyWriteExecute=yes
SystemCallFilter=@system-service
SystemCallArchitectures=native
```

## inetd

The classic "internet super-server" can run sniproxy when the first
connection comes in, with a line in `/etc/inetd.conf` like this:

```
https stream tcp wait sniproxy /usr/bin/sniproxy sniproxy
```

## s6

The process supervision suite [s6][] provides tools for setting up a
process like this, in conjunction with [s6-networking][]. Here's a
sample script written using the [execline][] language for listening on
IPv6; a similar script covers IPv4 as well.

[s6-networking]: http://skarnet.org/software/s6-networking/
[execline]: http://skarnet.org/software/execline/

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env -S execlineb -P
s6-tcpserver6-socketbinder :: 443
s6-setuidgid sniproxy
cd /srv/sniproxy
/usr/bin/sniproxy
```
